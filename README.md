I am a fan of R.
I like Github, Stackoverflow, CrossValidated, Asana/Trello, Harvest.
I use Rstudio for R, knitr for reports, and slidify for presentation.
I don't like word but have to use it.
I like also Pandoc.
I am interested in Python, Ruby on Rails, Jekyll/nanco but haven't got time to learn them in depth.
